# Pomotime

https://pomotime.web.app

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by 5-minute breaks. After 4 pomodoros, you can take longer breaks of usually 10 to 20 minutes long.

This is a web application for Pomodoro Technique created for Dev Jams. The project is based off of <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Pomodoro-Clock.md">app-ideas/pomodoro-clock</a> by <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17">github.com/florinpop17</a>
